    Hi, I'm Dawn! Currently, I teach CS 61B at UC Berkeley and organize with our academic workers' union, UAW 4811. I'm also an undergrad at Berkeley studying Data Science and Applied Math, which I try not to let be secondary to all of the other stuff I do.

    If you're one of my students and you're lost, **don't worry, you're in the right place!** Click "teaching" on the navigation to access any materials I've made.
